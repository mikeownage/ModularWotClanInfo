Modular WoT Clan Info
=====================
Mike's Fork
---------------------
Updated Fork by Mike working as of 4/19/2013, however provinces have been disabled if I get the time I will fix them.


Short explanation
-----------------

It is possible to search for clans by tag and by name. A possibilities-feature like in the original WotClanInfo Tool is planned and will hopefully be released in the near future.
You can see player-stats by clicking on an item in the players list on the right. Unselect works with CTRL+Click or CTRL+Space.
By hovering over a tank name you can see the players owning this tank in the players list. Clicking on a tank name lets you see this players list until you have clicked on it again.
This tool can only show ALL tanks owned by the clan members. This means that it doesn't display tanks the clan doesn't own. You can also specify a minimum tier for each vehicle class to display.
