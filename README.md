Modular WoT Clan Info
=====================

This is a complete rewrite of the original WotClanInfo Tool.
It creates parts of its UI dynamically so there should be no update needed when new tanks are added to the game.
Altough this programm is still in development and a lot of features should be added in the near future.


Short explanation
-----------------

It is possible to search for clans by tag and by name. A possibilities-feature like in the original WotClanInfo Tool is planned and will hopefully be released in the near future.
You can see player-stats by clicking on an item in the players list on the right. Unselect works with CTRL+Click or CTRL+Space.


Planned
-------

* possible clans feature
* more clan info (provinces, gold earned per day, etc.)
* performance improvements
* ...
* probably with 8.0 :
** per-vehicle efficiency -> avg. top tank efficiency
