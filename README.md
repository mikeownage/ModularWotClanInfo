Modular WoT Clan Info

Updated Fork by Mike working as of 4/19/2013, however provinces have been disabled if I get the time I will fix them.
=====================

This is a complete rewrite of the original WotClanInfo Tool.
It creates parts of its UI dynamically so there should be no update needed when new tanks are added to the game.
Altough this programm is still in development and a lot of features should be added in the near future.


Short explanation
-----------------

It is possible to search for clans by tag and by name. A possibilities-feature like in the original WotClanInfo Tool is planned and will hopefully be released in the near future.
You can see player-stats by clicking on an item in the players list on the right. Unselect works with CTRL+Click or CTRL+Space.
By hovering over a tank name you can see the players owning this tank in the players list. Clicking on a tank name lets you see this players list until you have clicked on it again.
This tool can only show ALL tanks owned by the clan members. This means that it doesn't display tanks the clan doesn't own. You can also specify a minimum tier for each vehicle class to display.


Planned
-------

* possible clans feature
* more clan info (provinces, gold earned per day, etc.)
* performance improvements
* ...
* probably with 8.0 :
* per-vehicle efficiency -> avg. top tank efficiency
* and more based on the stats released with 8.0
